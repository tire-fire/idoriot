# flyctl launch added from idoriot/.gitignore
# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
idoriot/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
idoriot/log/*
idoriot/tmp/*
!idoriot/log/.keep
!idoriot/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
idoriot/tmp/pids/*
!idoriot/tmp/pids
!idoriot/tmp/pids/.keep


idoriot/public/assets

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
idoriot/config/master.key
fly.toml
